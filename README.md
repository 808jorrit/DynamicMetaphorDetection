# DynamicMetaphorDetection
Dynamic metaphor detection on U.S.-China trade war dataset


This is a placeholder on which the code will be uploaded that was used for my master's thesis. As the code is scattered between a lot of files, as i worked paralell on two different devices, some code may be incomplete. All code has been used but some parts may not be included in this release due to their irrelevance. F.e. loading the excell sheet multiple times was problematic due to it messing up types / formatting. code to repeatedly fix these issues is not included (or partially). In case anything misses please inform me and it will be uploaded as soon as possible.
